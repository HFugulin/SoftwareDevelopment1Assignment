# SoftwareDevelopment1Assignment
First assignment for 202430-CEN-3024C-33022 is creating this repository, including this README file.

My name is Hanna Melo Fugulin, making this for the Software Development 1 course (202430-CEN-3024C-33022).

I uploaded files from my very first Object Oriented Project (COP3330C) class. The program objective was to develop a simple program using the first few concepts we had learned for object-oriented programming, basically to implement a program using classes and objects. It creates and defines two classes (boxing and archery), as well as an executable main class SportsApp which demonstrates the creation and uses of objects (and prints it). The code itself is pretty thoroughly commented (as per instructions by the Professor).
