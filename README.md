# SoftwareDevelopment1Assignment
First assignment for 202430-CEN-3024C-33022 is creating this repository, including this README file.

My name is Hanna Melo Fugulin, making this for the Software Development 1 course (202430-CEN-3024C-33022).

I uploaded files from my very first Object Oriented Project (COP3330C) class. The program objective was to develop a simple program using the first few concepts we had learned for object-oriented programming, basically to implement a program using classes and objects. It creates and defines two classes (boxing and archery), as well as an executable main class SportsApp which demonstrates the creation and uses of objects (and prints it). The code itself is pretty thoroughly commented (as per instructions by the Professor).

The breakdown of parameters, inputs, and outputs include: 
Class: Archery. Represents Archery as a sport. Defines details on bow usage, number of arrows, and range distance (m). It takes in BowUsed as a String, ArrowsShot as an int, and Distance as a double.
Class: Boxing. Represents Boxing as a sport. Defines details on weight classes, boxing styles, and match length (min). It takes in Weight Class and Boxing Style as strings and Match Length as a double.
Class: SportsApp. Main class to demonstrate the creation and use of objects, as well as print it. Instantiates objects and assigns attributes to them. It prints all attributes after having methods change its defined values.
